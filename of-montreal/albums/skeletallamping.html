        <h1>Skeletal Lamping (2008)</h1>
				<p>Kevin Barnes sticks to his alter ego, Georgie Fruit, in of Montreal's ninth studio album, <i>Skeletal Lamping</i>. The title of the album translates literally to the theme of this album.
					Barnes states that the album is a conglomeration of all of the thoughts possesses his mind in order to make sense of them through his art. "Skeletal" meaning his brain, and "Lamping" is a technique used to dazzle animals
					so that they can be more closely approached and examined.</p>

						<h2 class="unfloat">Featured Track</h2>
						<p><b>Gallery Piece</b></p>
						<p>In my opinion, this track is the most epic love song in the history of music. Barnes repeats the beginning phrase "I wanna" and elaborates on all the things he wants out of a relationship.
							He speaks truthfully about the good, the bad, and the ugly that is associated with crazy, intense love.</p>

						<p><b>Lyrics</b><br>
							I wanna be your love<br>
							I wanna make you cry<br>
							And sweep you off your feet<br>
							I wanna hurt your pride<br>
							I wanna slap your face<br>
							I wanna paint your nails<br>
							I wanna make you you scream<br>
							I wanna braid your hair<br>
							I wanna kiss your friends<br>
							I wanna make you laugh<br>
							I wanna dress the same<br>
							I wanna defend you<br>
							I wanna squeeze your thighs<br>
							I wanna kiss your eyelids<br>
							And corrupt your dreams<br>
							I wanna crash your car<br>
							I wanna scratch your cheeks<br>
							I wanna make you sick<br>
							I wanna sell you out<br>
							Want to expose your flaws<br>
							I wanna steal your things<br>
							I wanna show you off<br>
							I wanna tell you lies<br>
							I wanna write you books<br>
							I wanna turn you on<br>
							I wanna make you cum<br>
							Two-hundred times a day<br>
							I wanna dry tears<br>
							Every time your sad<br>
							I wanna be your what's happening<br>
							I wanna be your only friend<br><br>
							I only go all the way<br>
							This time I'm not pretending<br>
							I can't take the trash<br>
							Your trashy friends are spreading about us<br>
							They've got like fifty personalities<br>
							Oh girl, that's so messed up<br>
							You see that sculpture on the hill?<br>
							That's where she cleared me out<br>
							Forever<br>
							They're monitoring my sub-conscious massacres I know<br>
							Bringing it closer to the surface so it's easily pervertable<br><br>
							I want to be a beast<br>
							I want to make you proud<br>
							And play with your head<br>
							I want to take you out<br>
							Make you feel adored<br>
							And buy you everything<br>
							I want to hurt you bad<br>
							Make you paranoid<br>
							And say the sweetest things<br>
							I want to help you grow<br>
							And for eternity<br>
							I want to be your what's happening<br><br>
							What's happening?
