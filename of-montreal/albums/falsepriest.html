        <h1>False Priest (2010)</h1>
				<p>Barnes experiments with elements of R&amp;B in of Montreal's tenth album, <i>False Priest</i>. Solange Knowles and Janelle Monae are both featured on this album, adding to the
					R&amp;B theme. There are a lot of strange, digressive elements in some songs that give this album a "wow" factor. It has the funky and dancey feel that of Montreal is known for.</p>

					<p><b>Our Riotous Defects (feat. Janelle Monae)</b></p>
					<p>I chose to feature this particular song because it is my favorite from the album. Barnes tells the story of meeting a woman through Alcoholics Anonymous,
						and how their love story turns sour when she turns out to be literally insane. The song is a monologue of sorts that describes ridiculous situations in a didactic tone.
						Janelle Monae wraps up the song, with her lovely voice echoing over soft flute tones until it fades out.</p>

					<p><b>Lyrics</b><br>
						You are such a crazy girl<br>
						And I don't know why I even tried to make you love me.<br>
						I want it babe but you are just a<br>
						Crazy girl, you are such a crazy girl and I don't why<br>
						I even try to help you.<br><br>
						When I first met you at that al-anon meeting<br>
						You made that reference to "All Your Goodies Are Gone"<br>
						And even sang a verse, I was amazed how husky your singing voice was.<br>
						I wanted to talk to you so badly but I didn't know how to come on because<br>
						You've got that kind of beauty that makes people nervous.<br>
						I know it's fucked, but before we got together I even hooked up with one of your cousins<br>
						Just to feel somehow closer to you<br>
						Because I knew like you guys were best friends and you talked everyday<br>
						And it was thrilling to touch something that had touched you.<br>
						In my head you were like this goddess, but, in fact, you're just a<br><br>
						Crazy girl<br>
						You're just a crazy girl.<br>
						I don't know why I even try<br>
						To understand you (can't stand you).<br>
						Your ass is crazy girl.<br>
						You are so crazy girl<br>
						And I don't know why I even try<br>
						To relate to you (can't wait for you, it's too late for you).<br><br>
						My god I should have realized, on our second date<br>
						When you dragged me into the bathroom at Tanika's house<br>
						And screamed at me for like twenty minutes<br>
						Cause I had contradicted you in front of your friends,<br>
						I was like "oh"<br>
						And then later that night at my apartment<br>
						As punishment you killed my beta fish,<br>
						Just threw it out the window.<br>
						I did everything I could to make you happy.<br>
						I participated in all your protests,<br>
						Supported your stupid little blog,<br>
						Got a Bowflex, wore colored contacts to match your dresses,<br>
						Whatever your eyes caught I bought,<br>
						Still we fought<br>
						Like Ike and Tina but in reverse<br>
						Cause you're so<br><br>
						Crazy girl<br>
						You're just too crazy girl<br>
						And I don't know why I even try to understand you.<br>
						Well... I think you're crazy girl, you are so crazy girl<br>
						And I don't know why I even try to make sense of you.<br>
						Oh tell me why,<br>
						Someone tell me why my heart's real weird for you still.<br><br>
						I was like crazy fan over you<br>
						Like I'm all star struck over you<br>
						Like I'm getting handcuffed over you.<br><br>
						Now it's only fucked up.<br><br>
						[Janelle Mon√°e:]<br>
						My frame works in constant confusion.<br>
						I can't peel away the flowers of this psychic disturbance<br>
						And our riotous defects.
