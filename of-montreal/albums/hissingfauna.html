							<p><b>Lyrics</b><br>
								Nihilists with good imaginations<br><br>
								I am satisfied hiding in our friend's apartment<br>
								Only leaving once a day to buy some groceries<br>
								Daylight, I'm so absent minded, nighttime meeting new anxieties<br>
								So am I erasing myself? Hope I'm not erasing myself<br><br>
								I guess it would be nice to give my heart to a God<br>
								But which one, which one do I choose?<br>
								All the churches filled with losers, psycho or confused<br>
								I just want to hold the divine in mine<br>
								And forget, all of the beauty's wasted<br><br>
								Let's fall back to earth and do something pleasant, say it<br>
								We fell back to earth like gravity's bitches, bitches<br>
								Physics makes us all its bitches<br><br>
								I guess it would be nice to help in your escape<br>
								From patterns your parents designed<br>
								All the party people dancing for the indie star<br>
								But he's the worst faker by far in the set<br>
								I forget, all of the beauty's wasted<br><br>
								I guess it would be nice<br>
								Show me that things can be nice<br>
								I guess it would be nice<br>
								Show me that things can be nice<br><br>
								You've got my back in the city<br>
								You've got my back 'cause I don't want to panic<br>
								You've got my back in the city<br>
								You've got my back 'cause I don't want to panic
