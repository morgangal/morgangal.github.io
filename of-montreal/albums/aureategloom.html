        <h1>Aureate Gloom (2015)</h1>
					<p>In his 13th album, Kevin Barnes gives new life to the name of Montreal. After a couple albums received poor reviews, <i>Aureate Gloom</i> gave of Montreal a resurgence,
						being compared to <i>Hissing Fauna</i> in terms of gripping, emotional lyrics paired with funky, upbeat melodies. The album is a bit disjointed and lacks a central focus;
						one can get lost among the dynamic of the sounds.</p>

						<p><b>Bassem Sabry</b></p>

							leading to his distrust in any type of leader or figure of authority.</p>

						<p><b>Lyrics</b><br>
							Look at our electric guitars<br>
							And, if not for the good people weeping<br>
							All we'd hear is sounds of our horses dying<br>
							But I'm not 'bout to start crying about it<br>
							It must be fairly normal<br>
							To devolve into cycloptic brooding<br>
							As the genocidal massacres you rubbed<br>
							Over some perceived sedition<br>
							Insecurities of men messing everything up again<br><br>
							I'll never follow no kind of master's voice<br>
							The mutinous tramp of cold voltage crucifixion is my conduit<br>
							I just watched my hero fail<br>
							Now I'm in a dark and violent funk<br>
							Every leader is a cellophane punk<br>
							If you hear me say "yeah!" (Yeah!)<br>
							"Yeah!" (Yeah!) "Yeah!" (Yeah!) "Yeah!" (Yeah!)<br><br>
							There must be a softer vision that you could kick to<br>
							In this aureate gloom, I assume<br>
							Both sides are embarrassingly backwards in their thinking<br>
							Bearing no one to side with, none I want to defend<br>
							People disappear on the wrong side of this revolution<br>
							When they resurface, there's a black hole in their skull<br>
							People disappear on the wrong side of this revolution<br>
							When they'll return, all their childhood memories are dead<br><br>
							I'll never follow no kind of master's voice<br>
							The mutinous tramp of cold vulture crucifixion is my conduit<br>
							I just watched my hero fail<br>
							Now I'm in a dark and violent funk<br>
							Every leader is a cellophane punk<br>
							If you hear me say "yeah!" (Yeah!)<br>
							"Yeah!" (Yeah!) "Yeah!" (Yeah!) "Yeah!" (Yeah!)<br>
							I'll never follow no kind of master's voice<br>
							The mutinous tramp of cold voltage crucifixion is my conduit<br>
							I just watched my hero fail<br>
							Now I'm in a dark and violent funk<br>
							Every leader is a cellophane punk<br>
							If you hear me say "yeah!" (Yeah!)<br>
							"Yeah!" (Yeah!) "Yeah!" (Yeah!) "Yeah!" (Yeah!)<br>
							Yeah!<br><br>
							I believe in witches<br>
							I believe in you<br>
							I believe in witches<br>
							I believe in you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you<br>
							I believe in witches<br>
							I believe in you<br>
							I believe in witches<br>
							I believe in you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
