					<p><b>Neat Little Domestic Life</b></p>
					<p>This song tells of a couple that coexists in harmony, each doing their own work that benefits the both of them. They have found their niche within each other.
						The lyrics are simple-minded and do not delve into the emotions, just the surface of the "Neat Little Domestic Life".</p>

					<p><b>Lyrics</b><br>
						You clean the bathroom<br>
						And I do the dishes.<br>
						I water the lawn<br>
						And you feed the fishes.<br>
						What a neat little domestic life that we live.<br><br>
						You change the light bulb and I hold the ladder.<br>
						I get the frying pan and you mix the batter.<br>
						What a neat little domestic life that we live.<br><br>
						All the lonely days are gone.<br>
						Those long lonely days when I was alone<br>
						And I felt this world was not the place I belonged<br>
						But then I met you and now I belong.<br><br>
						You rake the leaves and I start a fire.<br>
						I clean out the shed and you turn on the dryer.<br>
						What a neat little domestic life that we live.<br><br>
						I brush the dog and you knit a sweater.<br>
						You vacuum the rug and I write a letter.<br>
						What a neat little domestic life that we live.<br><br>
						I clear the table and you draw the curtain.<br>
						You ask if I'm happy and I tell you I'm certain<br>
						That this neat little domestic life is for me.
