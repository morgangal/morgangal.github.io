        <h1>Cherry Peel (1997)</h1>
				<p>This album was the first of many of Montreal creations. Before of Montreal made a name for themselves, the band was a part of a collective called Elephant 6
					with various other bands who produced their music through the support and collaboration with one another. This debut album reveals the early style of the band,
					more simplistic and acoustic.</p>

        <h2 class="unfloat">Featured Track</h2>
          <p><b>Don't Ask Me to Explain</b></p>
					<p>I picked to feature this song because it is my favorite from the album. I love the rawness and originality found from this first album,
						and I think this song serves as a good example for what the album sounds like. Barnes describes someone who is unable to understand how to love someone who is emotionally unavailable.</p>

              <p><b>Lyrics</b><br>
              How will I ever know you enough to love you<br>
              if you're hiding who you are?<br>
              Don't ask me to explain.<br>
              Who are you hiding you from,<br>
              across the table with a penny in each eye?<br>
              Don't ask me to explain.<br><br>
              I'd like to marry all of my close friends,<br>
              And live in a big house together by an angry sea.<br>
              Am I the devil's marbles don't move on without me<br>
              Who will be watching my body when I sleep?<br>
              Who will I believe in?<br><br>
              How am I supposed to let it show when I don't even know?<br>
              Don't ask me to explain.<br>
              Besides, I don't want to be the one whose coming out first,<br>
              I'd really like to but I'm just too shy.<br>
              Don't ask me to explain.<br><br>
              I'd want to marry all of my close friends,<br>
              And live in a big house together by an angry sea.<br>
              Am I the devil's marbles don't move on without me<br>
              Who will be watching my body when I sleep?<br>
              Who will I believe in?<br><br>
              It's so easy to lie to myself<br>
              and pretend that I could love you but I can't
