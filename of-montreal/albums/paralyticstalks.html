        <h1>Paralytic Stalks (2012)</h1>
				<p>The tenth album out of the fourteen that of Montreal has produced drifts away from the well-known poppy vibe surrounding the band. The lyrics do not stray; they still posses the emotional rawness of Barnes' inner mind.
					The songs within themselves are very dynamic and contain various switches of sounds throughout. The album possesses a wide array of music styles. Barnes collaborated with artist Kishi Bashi in the production <i>Paralytic Stalks</i>.</p>

						<p><b>We Will Commit Wolf Murder</b></p>
						<p>This song demonstrates the type of emotional rawness that this album possesses. Barnes is lost and has little to no one to trust in and rely on.
							He is having internal conflicts with his feelings about his wife, Nina.</p>

						<p><b>Lyrics</b><br>
							Something's terrorized my psyche to get even<br>
							Lately you're the only human I believe in<br>
							I tried to understand his logic<br>
							But there's just no pattern there<br>
							No sympathetic voices anywhere<br>
							There's blood in my hair<br><br>
							Now I'm considered ugly from every angle<br>
							You're the only beauty I don't want to strangle<br>
							Can't you hear me crying out for guidance?<br>
							Yes, we hear but we don't care<br>
							There's no sympathetic victims anywhere<br>
							There's blood in my hair<br><br>
							I want to get all fucked up and tell you how I really feel<br>
							Because your vibrant blackness coco artery is so unreal<br>
							When I die I want you to die too<br>
							Not try to stay in this all<br>
							In a dimension without you, spit on this planet without you<br>
							I envy you because you can believe in things like I never could<br>
							And like, dose yourself into a coma over the bestiality of our race<br>
							All I meant how to send into some ancient reptilian form like an agnostic transsensiation<br>
							Don't know what that is (use your imagination)<br><br>
							They paralyze my psyche to get even<br>
							Lately you're the only dancer I believe in<br>
							I would put your dower's blood in my hair<br>
							No sympathetic voices anywhere<br>
							There's blood in my hair<br><br>
							Anti human armies spring from every angle<br>
							You're the only soldier I don't want to strangle<br>
							I can see this intolerance fate<br>
							So don't expect us to cooperate<br>
							Anyway, it's five lives too late<br>
							And there's blood in my hair<br><br>
							Harbors<br>
							Our most obliging harbor<br>
							For this illusion movies<br>
							I wish I'd be stung by<br>
							Tears of confusion<br>
							Will you<br>
							meet the common end to<br>
							your odd shaped mission?<br>
							Though it isn't true<br>
							I don't believe in that kind of plot<br>
							But still I pray for you<br><br>
							We will produce verity holocausts<br>
							We will commit acts of misery<br>
							We will weaponize silence in a sense<br>
							And we'll forget<br><br>
							Someone's terrorized my psyche to get even<br>
							Lately you're the only human I believe in<br>
							I suffer from this death to find a kingdom raised<br>
							Terror corpses in the vapor, martyr's wrapped in butcher paper<br><br>
							In the fall a monster possessed your mind<br>
							You're the only dancer I don't want to strangle<br>
							Can't you hear me crying out for guidance?<br>
							Yes, we hear but we don't care<br>
							There's no sympathetic voices anywhere<br>
							There's blood in my hair<br><br>
							I saw you laughing, but tomorrow you'll say you were there<br>
							You looked at me in disgust. Girl, why should I care?<br><br>
							There's blood in my hair<br>
							There's blood in my hair<br>
							There's blood in my hair<br>
							Blood in my hair<br>
							Fuck
