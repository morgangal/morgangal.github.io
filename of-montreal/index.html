				<h1>About of Montreal</h1>
				<p>Of Montreal has been creating ecclectic and energizing hits for over 20 years. The band was founded by Kevin Barnes, lead singer and frontman, in 1996. He relocated to Athens, Georgia, where he met Derek Almstead and Bryan Poole.
					Members have come and gone throughout the years, including influential members such as Dottie Alexander and James Husband, but Kevin Barnes is the only remaining original member. Of Montreal, the band, is more of an alter ego/stage name for Kevin Barnes;
					he is the genius behind the music, creating each element and then presenting the final product to band members to play. Majority of the albums produced under the name of Montreal describe the beautiful, yet tragic life of Kevin, including his encounters with
					love, anger, depression, and isolation. By juxtaposing deep emotional struggles with happy, energetic pop beats, of Montreal has become a prolific band in the realms of indie music.</p>
