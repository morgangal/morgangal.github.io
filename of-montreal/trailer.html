        <h1>Documentary Trailer</h1>
				<p>In 2014, a documentary titled, <i>The Past is a Grotesque Animal</i> after their iconic twelve minute song, was released about the prolific band, of Montreal. The film details the evolution of the band, from the very beginning, through their peak, to the falling out.
					Featured are various band members that have come and gone throughout the years, friends of the band, and associates who toured alongside the band at some point in their career. It focuses mainly on Kevin Barnes
					and his personal relationships with his band members, love interests, and eventual family. The video below is a trailer that I made for the documentary, including the band at the different stages of thier career.</p>
